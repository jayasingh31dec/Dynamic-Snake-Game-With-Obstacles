#Dynamic Snake Game with Obstacles
This project is a Python-based Snake Game built using Tkinter. It features dynamic obstacles, increasing speed as you progress, and a score system that tracks your achievements. The game also includes a high score tracker and a reset button to restart the game after it ends.


Features
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated obstacles that change every time you restart the game.
Increasing Speed: As you collect food, the game gets progressively faster, increasing the challenge.
Score System: Keep track of your score, with a display for both current score and high score.
Reset Button: Easily restart the game once it's over by clicking the restart button.
Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.


How to Play
Objective: Control the snake to eat the food (red circles) while avoiding the walls, your own body, and obstacles (blue blocks).
Controls:
Arrow keys to move the snake:
Up: Move up
Down: Move down
Left: Move left
Right: Move right
Each time you eat food, your snake grows longer and the game speed increases.
Avoid running into the walls, your own body, or obstacles. If you do, the game is over.
Press the reset button to restart the game and play again.


Game Over
When the snake collides with itself, the walls, or an obstacle, the game ends. If you achieve a new high score, it will be displayed.


Future Enhancements
Add levels with increasing difficulty.
Implement a leaderboard system to save high scores across sessions.
